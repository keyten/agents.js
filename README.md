# agents.js

Runs a dialog of multiple AI agents that talk to each other and come up with a result.

Each agent has a personality based on its system prompt.

They're overseen by a `Director AI` that chooses who takes the wheel. Director may also stop the dialog to ask you some question (incl. if any of the AIs want to ask you that question).

For a demo check `write-linguistics-article.js`.
